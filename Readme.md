# AI Agent for Mujoco Environment using SB3

- This project trains reinforcement learning agents in various Mujoco environments using Stable Baselines3 (SB3).

## Supported Environments

- Hopper-v4
- Reacher-v4
- HalfCheetah-v4
- Humanoid-v4
- HumanoidStandup-v4

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x (Recommended: 3.7 or later)
- Gymnasium
- MuJoCo Py
- Stable-Baselines3 (pip install stable-baselines3[extra])

## Installation
- This project provides a starting point for training agents in Mujoco environments using SB3. You can customize the notebook to explore different environments, algorithms, and hyperparameters. Refer to the SB3 documentation for further exploration of its functionalities.
